# WHAT THIS IS:
	-This is an assembler for the TTP architecture
		-TTP stands for "Taks Toy Processor" it is a processor design used for a class I took
# TIPS AND USAGE:
	-To run do: ./asm <myasmfile>
		-the output will be placed in the file output.ram
		-if you have access to the Taks logisim files for his ttp processor then you can run your assembly
			on those
		-if you do not then don't worry you can run them just as easily on the emulator I created which you can 
		find at https://mehstruslehpy.neocities.org/projects.html
	-As an example try running the code under ./TestingPrograms
		type: ./asm TestingPrograms/Add.asm
# TODO:
	-clean up the source code and make it look pretty
	-doxygen docs?
	-test more thorougly
	-nicer error handling
	-clean up debug/logging output
	-fix very minor label/comment bugs
	-fix minor single char instruction matching bugs
